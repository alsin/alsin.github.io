###SubGit Documentation
Here are three basic tasks one may SubGit for. Follow links below to get detailed documentation. In case something is not clear or you experience a difficulty,
do not hesitate to contact us at [support@subgit.com](mailto:support@subgit.com) email address.
#####1. [Mirror Remote Subversion Repository](remote-book.html)
Create a Git repository that will mirror remote Subversion repository accessible over network. Translation from Git to Subversion is initiated on push operation and translation from Subversion to Git is performed asynchronously in background.
#####2. [Mirror Local Subversion Repository](book.html)
Install SubGit into Subversion repository on the server side. Both Subversion and Git repositories reside on the same server. Translation in both directions is initiated instantly and introduces minimal overhead.
#####3. [One Time Import from Subversion to Git](remote-book.html#7)
Perform one-time import of an existing Subversion project into Git. No synchronization is required.
