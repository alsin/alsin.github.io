## 3.1. Subversion Projects Location
Subversion repository may contain one or more projects. Project is a location (folder) in Subversion repository which follows Subversion recommended repository layout, i.e. project folder has trunk, branches and tags subfolders:

<pre>/project
/trunk    # project's "main line"
/branches # contains project feature and version branches, copied from trunk or other branches
/tags     # contains project tags (trunk and branches snapshots)</pre>

It is not necessary for trunk, branches and tags folders to have these exact names, but the roles of these folders are important. Each project could be mapped to a bare Git repository as shown in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.3 along with the corresponding parts of SubGit configuration file.

<pre>[svn]
# URL that points to a project root
# (may be the same as Subversion repository root)
url = http://host/svn/repos</pre>
