## 3.3. Authors Mapping
By default there is no explicit authors mapping and the following rules are used for translation:

Subversion "svn_user_name" is translated to "svn_user_name <>" in Git
Git "Author Name <email@domain.com>" is translated to "Author Name" in Subversion
Additionally to the default rule, explicit authors mapping may be provided by SubGit configuration. Authors mapping is stored in a separate text file which is looked at GIT_REPOS/subgit/authors.txt by default. Mapping file is read in system default encoding.

Figure 3.9. GIT_REPOS/subgit/authors.txt file

svn_user_name = Git Name <name@email.com>

Default authors.txt location may be changed in SubGit configuration file.

Figure 3.10. SubGit configuration file defines authors.txt location

<pre>[core]
...
# location of the authors mapping file
authorsFile = subgit/authors.txt
...</pre>

Authors mapping file (authors.txt) contents may be altered at any time and new mapping becomes effective immediately.
