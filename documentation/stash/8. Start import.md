##8. Enable Mirror

Finally, click **Mirror** button to start initial connection process.*

Wait for a bit and that's all. 
SVN Mirror updates header as soon as import is done. Now you have Git repository synchronized with specified Subversion repository. You can use it as a normal Git repository hosted by Atlassian Stash.
You will see the commits pushed to SVN in your Git repository and vice versa.

After synchronisation is finished, mirroring is turned on. You can switch it off and turn it on again any time you want. Commits pushed to Git while the mirror was switched off would be marked as unsynced and would be presented on the related tab.

You can change configuration, connection settings, authors mapping any time you want.
