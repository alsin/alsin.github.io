###5.2. Applying configuration changes

SubGit configuration could be changed after SubGit is installed into repository. Some of the changes become effective immediately and others require subgit *install* or *subgit install --rebuild* command to be executed in order for the changes to be applied.

As with all other SubGit commands, *subgit install* command should be ran on behalf of the user that runs service that access Subversion or Git repository (see [Section 4.2, “Setup Service Accounts”](#9)).

**Changes that become effective immediately:**

+ Modification of the authors mapping file (conf/authors.txt)
+ Modification or creation of the user-\* hook scripts

**Changes that become effective after 'subgit install' is run:**

+ Modification of the [core.authorsFile](high) and [core.shared](high) options in [subgit.conf](high) file
+ Addition of the new [[git]](high) section to the [subgit.conf](high) file

[subgit install](high) command will validate changes made to the [subgit.conf](high) and apply these changes. If necessary, file permissions would be updated and new Git repositories would be created.

> **Note:**<br>
> To remove existing [[git]](high) section, i.e. to disable synchronization of a selected project in Subversion repository, it is recommended to run [subgit uninstall](high) first, then to remove [[git]](high) section and the to run [subgit install](high) to apply changes. This way one would ensure that SubGit specific hooks are removed from the Git repository.

Changes that become effective after 'subgit install --rebuild' is run:

+ Modification of the existing projects and branches mappings (any modifications within [git] sections of the subgit.conf file)

--rebuild option of the [install](high) command will make SubGit to back up existing Git repositories and to regenerate them using new mapping and translation options.
