##Chapter 6. Uninstalling SubGit

Run [subgit uninstall](high) command to disable synchronization or to uninstall SubGit completely.
Being run without options [uninstall](high) command removes SubGit hooks thus disabling translation:

    $ [sudo -u www-data] subgit uninstall svn_repository
    SubGit version 1.0.2 ('Miai') build #1730

    SubGit hooks have been removed from Git repository:
        /var/svn/svn_repository/.git

    SubGit hooks have been removed from Subversion repository:
        /var/svn/svn_repository

    Subversion and Git are no longer kept in sync.

Until Subversion and Git histories diverge, you may run SubGit [subgit install](high) to enable synchronization back.

Run [subgit uninstall](high) command with the [--purge](high) option to remove SubGit completely. This command will remove:

+ SubGit hooks (user hooks will be restored)
+ SubGit binaries and log files
+ SubGit metadata

Git repository will **not** be removed by the [uninstall --purge](high) command, but it will be no longer be kept in sync with the Subversion repository. To restore synchronization later one will have to run [subgit configure](high) command followed by [subgit install --rebuild](high) one just as in case of the fresh install (see [Section 4.1, “Installation Stages”](#8)).
