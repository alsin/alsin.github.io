###1.5 Stop mirroring

To to this moment a Git repository mirroring an SVN repository is created. To stop the continuous synchronization temporarily run

    $ subgit uninstall kafka.git

This command will remove SubGit-related hooks from the repository, but will leave other SubGit-related structure allowing to re-enable the synchronization later with `subgit install` command.

To remove all SubGit-related data run

    $ subgit uninstall --purge kafka.git

instead. After this command the continuous synchronization can't be re-enabled anymore.

Now you have a Git repository imported from the SVN repository.
