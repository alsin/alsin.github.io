SubGit Documentation Markdown
===================================
It is important to put the title in quotes in order to display it properly.

SubGit markdown syntax:

\#\# Chapter caption

\* *italic or emphasized* \*

\*\* **strong or bold** \*\*

\!\[alt text\]\(\{\{ site.baseurl \}\}/img/image_name.png\) is how you insert an image, where you change only "alt text" which is text to be inserted into alt="" attribute of image tag and "image_name.png" which is file name located in /img/ directory.

Each paragraph starts with just a new line.

Unordered list:

+ Item one
+ Item two
+ Item n

Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

\\   backslash  
\`   backtick  
\*   asterisk  
\_   underscore  
\{\}  curly braces  
\[\]  square brackets  
\(\)  parentheses  
\#   hash mark  
\+   plus sign  
\-   minus sign (hyphen)  
\.   dot
